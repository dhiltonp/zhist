## ZFS History - simplified usage of ZFS snapshots

The purpose of zhist is to simplify access to past ZFS snapshots. Currently, a command-line interface a-la 'ls' exists. Ultimately, a GUI allowing easy browsing of history would be ideal.

Main features:
 * Specify a valid filename and all snapshots will be searched for the existence of that file, whether or not it currently exists.

Currently the code has only been tested on MacOS, but it has been developed so that refactoring will not be difficult.
